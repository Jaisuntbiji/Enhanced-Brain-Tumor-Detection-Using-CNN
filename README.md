# Brain Tumor Detection System

## Overview
This project is a high-accuracy brain tumor detection system (98%) leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system provides a user-friendly web interface for uploading MRI scans, which are then processed to classify and localize tumors in real time.

## Features
- **High Accuracy (98%)**: Utilizes a CNN-based model for reliable tumor detection.
- **Web Interface**: Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for ease of use.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Immediate classification and localization of tumors.
- **Database Integration**: MySQL is used for efficient data management.
- **Backend Processing**: Powered by Flask for handling user uploads and executing the detection model.

## Technologies Used
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Back-End**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Machine Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jaisuntbiji/Enhanced-Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-CNN.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd brain-tumor-detection
   ```
4. Set up the MySQL database:
   - Create a database in MySQL.
   - Import the provided SQL schema.
5. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
6. Access the web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage
1. Upload an MRI scan via the web interface.
2. The system processes the image and provides real-time tumor classification results.
3. View results and analysis.
